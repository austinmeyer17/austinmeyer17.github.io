8.) 

The two questions I wanted to investigate by using these databases were:
	A.) Is there a correlation between counties that have more veterans and a higher rate of guns in that county?
	B.) What states have the highest average gun totals per 1000 veterans?


At first I did a database query to find the amount of veterans in a county and how many guns that county has received.

I then exported that to google spreadsheets to start doing some more pointed investigating. To find out the question to A I did a pivot table scatter plot graph. I found that the amount of guns-per-1000 vets stayed relatively the same no matter how many veterans were in the county. I found that there did not seem to be a strong correlation between counties with more veterans and higher gun rates in the county.

So I started playing around with the data and used a pivot table to find the average gun totals per 1000 veterans for each state.

I then exported this back into my main spreadsheet and added the KML state boundaries so I could map the data in a fusion table.  ![spreadsheet](http://i.imgur.com/GokyJnC.png?1)

The resulting map looked like this:

Therefore, the data shows that the states that North Dakota has the most guns per 1000 veterans out of any state in the nation (17.43). Wyoming (17.23) and Montana (16.21) come in close second and third. One pattern that can also be seen from examining the map is that the north east does not have many guns per 1000 veterans. Interesting.
